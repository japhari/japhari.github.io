**Role**  
Lead System Architect & Developer

**Project Summary**  
The Government of Tanzania Health Management Information System (GOT-HOMIS) is a centralized health data management system designed to streamline healthcare services across Tanzania. The system facilitates real-time collection, storage, and analysis of patient data, enabling healthcare providers to improve service delivery and support data-driven decision-making in the health sector. GOT-HOMIS has been implemented in various phases, from version 2.0 to 4.0, with enhancements in each iteration to address emerging healthcare challenges and improve system scalability and integration.

**Key Contributions**

- **Design and Development Leadership**  
  Played a pivotal role in the design and development of multiple GOT-HOMIS versions (2, 2.5, 3, and 4.0). Led the end-to-end development lifecycle from requirements gathering to implementation and deployment.
  
- **System Requirement Specification (SRS)**  
  Created comprehensive System Requirement Specification Documents (SRS) for each version. These documents outlined the functional and non-functional requirements, including system performance, security, and usability.
  
- **System Design Document (SDD)**  
  Drafted detailed System Design Documents (SDD) that defined the system architecture, database schema, and data flow diagrams. This included the design of relational databases for storing patient records and a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers.
  
- **Team Collaboration**  
  Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams, including healthcare professionals, government stakeholders, and IT specialists, to ensure the system met real-world healthcare needs. Managed cross-functional teams responsible for the development, testing, and deployment of the system.
  
- **Integration with Existing Healthcare Infrastructure**  
  Led efforts to ensure seamless integration of GOT-HOMIS with existing healthcare systems, including electronic medical records (EMR), laboratory information systems, and financial systems. This helped in creating a unified platform that supports various healthcare operations, from patient registration to billing and reporting.

- **Data-Driven Healthcare Improvement**  
  The implementation of GOT-HOMIS has significantly improved data collection and management, allowing for better resource allocation, patient care, and public health reporting. The system enables decision-makers to use accurate, up-to-date information for planning and policy development.

**Impact**  
The deployment of GOT-HOMIS across Tanzanian healthcare facilities has led to;

- Improved efficiency in managing patient records and health data.
- Better resource allocation by providing healthcare administrators with real-time data insights.
- Enhanced patient care through the timely sharing of medical information between healthcare providers.
- Strengthened health policy decision-making by offering accurate data for government and health officials.
