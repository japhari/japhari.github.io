Software Developer

**Project Summary**  
The Facility Financial Account and Reporting System (FFARS) is a comprehensive financial management system designed to enhance the accuracy, accessibility, and transparency of financial operations in local government authorities (LGAs) across Tanzania. It supports facilities in managing their budgets, grants, and own-source revenue while ensuring real-time financial reporting and compliance with national and international standards. FFARS integrates directly with systems such as PlanRep (for planning and budgeting) and Epicor (for accounting), streamlining financial operations from the facility to the national level.

**Key Contributions**

- **System Development Leadership**  
  Led the end-to-end development of both web and mobile applications for FFARS, facilitating the management of budgets, grants, and financial reporting at the facility level. 

- **Financial Reporting and Transparency**  
  Designed and implemented real-time financial reporting capabilities, enabling local government facilities to generate accurate financial reports. The system allows stakeholders at all levels—facility, council, regional, and ministry—to access financial data in real time, supporting better decision-making and financial transparency.

- **Budget Control & Grant Management**  
  FFARS includes robust tools for budget control, allowing local facilities to plan, allocate, and track their budgets. The system also supports the management of external funding sources, including grants from national funds, ensuring that funds are used effectively and appropriately.

- **Seamless Bank Reconciliation**  
  Integrated the system with banking platforms to automate the reconciliation of facility accounts with bank records. This automation reduced manual errors, streamlined financial workflows, and ensured that all financial transactions were accurately reflected in the system.



- **User Management and Access Control**  
  Developed a hierarchical user management system, granting different levels of access to various users, including facility clerks, council admins, regional admins, and ministry-level super admins. This role-based access ensures that users can only perform tasks appropriate to their roles, enhancing security and accountability.

- **Mobile and Web Accessibility**  
  Created a mobile version of FFARS for Android devices to ensure that facilities in areas with limited infrastructure could still manage their financial data. The mobile app allows users to access and update financial information even when offline, syncing with the central database once internet access is restored.

- **Interoperability with High-Level Systems**  
  Ensured that FFARS is interoperable with existing government financial systems, such as PlanRep (for planning and budgeting) and Epicor (for expenditure tracking). This seamless integration facilitates accurate and comprehensive financial reporting across all levels of government.

**Impact**

- **Enhanced Financial Management**  
  The implementation of FFARS has significantly improved the financial management of local government authorities, allowing them to manage resources more efficiently, improve financial transparency, and ensure accountability.

- **Improved Resource Allocation**  
  By providing real-time insights into financial data, FFARS supports better decision-making, allowing local government authorities to allocate resources more effectively and respond to emerging financial challenges.


- **Compliance and Accountability**  
  FFARS ensures that facilities comply with Tanzanian financial regulations, including the preparation of consolidated financial statements, ensuring that local government authorities can track their financial activities and ensure compliance with auditing requirements.
