This report outlines the steps to set up a 2-node Hadoop cluster and Kafka for collecting
distributed data from multiple nodes, such as web logs. Additionally, it provides a guide to
writing a MapReduce code for web log analysis and setting up a dashboard for data
visualization. This setup ensures efficient data processing and real-time insights into the
collected data.
