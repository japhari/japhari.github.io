I had the incredible opportunity to attend a Tech Talk on the topic "AI Companion 2.0: Zoom Platform Oriented with Artificial Intelligence.” The session was graced by <b> Dr. Xuedong Huang </b>, Chief Technology Officer of Zoom (USA) and one of the world’s leading experts in speech recognition, language processing, and machine translation.

This talk showcased Dr. Xuedong’s impressive career, from founding Microsoft’s Speech Technology Group to leading Azure Cognitive Services, and now shaping the future of AI at Zoom. It was truly inspiring to learn about his human-parity breakthroughs and his vision for multilingual AI systems.

I was inspired by the discussions, particularly the potential of AI Companion 2.0. During the Q&A session, I asked Dr. Xuedong Xuedong Huang about how languages like <b> Swahili </b>, widely spoken in countries like Tanzania, could be accommodated in such platforms. I also explored the possibilities of future collaboration to bridge the gap in multilingual models and bring inclusivity to African languages in AI systems.
