**Reflecting on ATC 2024 - Pushing the Boundaries of Communication Technologies**

I recently had the privilege of attending the 2024 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2024), which took place in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from October 17-19. As someone passionate about advancing communication technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), this conference provided an amazing opportunity to engage with industry leaders, researchers, and experts in the field. Here are some highlights and key takeaways from my experience.

### **A Vital Forum for Research and Innovation**

ATC 2024 serves as a vital platform for researchers and innovators both in Vietnam and around the globe to exchange knowledge, share information, and present research results. The conference also aims to foster academic cooperation in the rapidly evolving field of communication technologies. This year's conference was particularly noteworthy, having received an impressive 307 submissions from 682 authors. Out of these, 176 excellent papers were selected for presentation—each representing cutting-edge contributions to the fields of electronics, communications, and related technologies.

The conference organizers have always been committed to promoting an international forum for scientific and technological exchange. By providing this platform, ATC 2024 succeeded in bringing together Vietnamese and international scientists to share high-quality research and build collaborative networks. This environment for academic cooperation and innovation is not only crucial for advancing the field but also serves as a catalyst for future breakthroughs in communication technologies.

### **Keynote Highlights**

One of the major highlights of ATC 2024 was the thought-provoking keynote sessions, which touched on current trends and the future landscape of communication technologies. Three sessions, in particular, stood out:

### **1. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Native Wireless Systems with Common Sense**
Delivered by **Prof. Walid Saad** from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, this keynote focused on the potential of AGI in revolutionizing wireless communication systems. Prof. Saad explored how AGI could be embedded into native wireless systems, allowing them to operate with "common sense" – a major leap toward intelligent, self-sufficient systems. The talk provided deep insights into how AI is increasingly converging with wireless networks, raising questions about autonomy, decision-making, and the future role of human operators in such systems.

### **2. Mega Constellations in 6G NTN: Trends, Technologies, and Vision**
**Prof. Symeon Chatzinotas**, an IEEE Fellow from the University of Luxembourg, gave a fascinating keynote on the deployment and vision for mega constellations in 6G non-terrestrial networks (NTN). As we approach the next generation of mobile communications, Prof. Chatzinotas explored how 6G will expand beyond terrestrial infrastructure, incorporating satellite constellations to create a global, interconnected communication system. This session opened my eyes to the technical challenges and the immense potential of 6G technologies in providing seamless connectivity even in the most remote areas of the globe.

### **3. Security and Privacy in Artificial Intelligence**
**Prof. Shuai Yu** from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) led a discussion on the growing concerns around security and privacy in AI systems. As AI becomes more integrated into every aspect of our lives, ensuring its safe deployment is crucial. Prof. Yu provided practical examples of security breaches in AI, illustrating why privacy must be at the forefront of AI system development. His insights on balancing innovation with safety struck a chord with many in the audience, myself included, as we look to build systems that are not only intelligent but also trustworthy.

### **Networking and Learning**

Beyond the impressive keynote sessions, ATC 2024 provided ample opportunities for networking and collaboration. I had the chance to meet and interact with fellow attendees from various backgrounds—academics, industry leaders, students, and technologists. The coffee breaks were as valuable as the sessions themselves, as they gave us the opportunity to discuss the keynotes, exchange ideas, and even brainstorm potential collaborations on future projects.

The panel discussions and group photo sessions also fostered a sense of community, as participants shared their perspectives on how we, as a global collective, can tackle the challenges in communication technologies. It was great to hear from others how they are applying cutting-edge research in AI, 6G, and wireless systems to solve real-world problems.

### **Looking to the Future: What’s Next?**

As I reflect on my experience at ATC 2024, I am filled with excitement and optimism for the future of communication technologies. The conference not only highlighted the incredible strides that have been made but also pointed to the immense possibilities that still lie ahead. From integrating Artificial General Intelligence into wireless systems to building a global, secure 6G network, the future of communications is bright, fast-moving, and full of potential.

One key takeaway for me is the importance of bridging the gap between technology and society. As we develop more advanced systems, ensuring their security, privacy, and accessibility will be critical. It’s not enough to innovate—we must also ensure that these technologies are safe and beneficial to all.

### **Final Thoughts**

Attending ATC 2024 was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of the current state and future of communication technologies. The knowledge gained from the keynote speakers, the engaging discussions, and the networking opportunities will no doubt inform my work going forward.

I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to my projects, especially in the fields of AI and 6G communications, and I look forward to continuing the conversation with the amazing professionals I met at the conference.

Thank you to the organizers, technical sponsors, and everyone who made ATC 2024 such a fantastic event! Looking forward to next year’s edition already.
