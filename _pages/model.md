# Machine Learning Models

Explore some of the most popular machine learning models used in the field:

## Decision Trees

A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

For more details, visit the [Decision Trees glossary entry](/machine-learning-glossary/models/trees/).

## Naive Bayes

**Naive Bayes** is a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors.

For more information, visit the [Naive Bayes glossary entry](/machine-learning-glossary/models/naivebayes/).

## Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a type of generative model that encodes input data into a latent space and can sample from it to generate new, similar data points.
