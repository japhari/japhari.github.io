# Projects üöÄ

- **Government of Tanzania Health Management Information System (GOT-HOMIS)**  
  Played a critical role in the design and development of multiple versions (2, 2.5, 3, 4.0) of GOT-HOMIS, a centralized health data management system aimed at improving healthcare services across Tanzania. Responsibilities included crafting comprehensive System Requirement Specification Documents (SRS) to define functional and non-functional requirements, as well as creating System Design Documents (SDD) that detailed system architecture, database schemas, and data flow. Led the implementation process, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to ensure seamless integration with existing healthcare infrastructure. This system has greatly enhanced data-driven decision-making, resource allocation, and patient care across the country.

- **Zanzibar Electronic Medical Record System (ZEMR)**  
  Designed and implemented a centralized Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system to streamline patient data management across Zanzibar‚Äôs health facilities. The system improved the accuracy, accessibility, and security of patient records, facilitating better healthcare delivery and administrative efficiency.

- **Facility Financial Account and Reporting System (FFARS)**  
  Developed both web and mobile applications for local government authorities to manage budgets, grants, and own-source revenue. The system offers real-time financial reporting and budget control, supporting local facilities in efficient financial management. It integrates directly with bank systems for seamless reconciliation and ensures financial transparency for stakeholders at multiple levels, including sector ministries and local government authorities.

- **Wadau Portal (Implementing Partners Management Portal)**  
  Created a web-based platform to help the Tanzanian government track and govern information about development partners and their research projects. This system serves as a central hub for monitoring, evaluation, and governance, improving transparency and accountability for projects in partnership with external organizations.

- **Annual School Census (ASC)**  
  Developed a robust system used to collect and manage educational data from Pre-Primary, Primary, Secondary, Adult, and Non-Formal Education institutions. The system streamlines the collection of data via school-level questionnaires and plays a pivotal role in education planning, resource distribution, and policy-making.

- **Madeni MIS**  
  Designed and developed an automated system for managing staff claims and non-salary debts across Tanzanian government departments. The system digitizes the entire claims process, ensuring transparency and accountability at all levels of approval. It significantly reduced the delays and inefficiencies associated with manual claim handling.

- **Muungano Gateway**  
  Developed a robust communication bus, serving as an interoperability layer for various electronic information systems in Tanzania. Muungano Gateway allows for seamless data exchange and integration across different government and institutional systems, improving interoperability and data sharing within and between public sector systems.
